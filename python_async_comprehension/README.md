# Python - Async Comprehension

## Learning Objectives
- How to write an asynchronous generator
- How to use async comprehensions
- How to type-annotate generators

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.9)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.

## Tasks
0. Write a coroutine called async_generator that takes no arguments.

The coroutine will loop 10 times, each time asynchronously wait 1 second, then yield a random number between 0 and 10. Use the random module.
1. Import async_generator from the previous task and then write a coroutine called async_comprehension that takes no arguments.

The coroutine will collect 10 random numbers using an async comprehensing over async_generator, then return the 10 random numbers.
2. Import async_comprehension from the previous file and write a measure_runtime coroutine that will execute async_comprehension four times in parallel using asyncio.gather.

measure_runtime should measure the total runtime and return it.

Notice that the total runtime is roughly 10 seconds, explain it to yourself.
